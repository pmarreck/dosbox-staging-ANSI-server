# DOSBox Staging

![GPL-2.0-or-later][gpl-badge]
[![Chat][discord-badge]][discord]

DOSBox Staging is a modern continuation of DOSBox with advanced features and current development practices.

It is a (mostly) drop-in replacement for older DOSBox versionsâ€”your existing configurations will continue to work, and you will have access to many advanced features.

For a detailed description of the project's scope please refer to the [About](https://www.dosbox-staging.org/about/) page on our website.

## Project website

https://www.dosbox-staging.org/

First-time users and people migrating from other DOSBox variants should start by reading the [Getting started guide](https://www.dosbox-staging.org/getting-started/).

## Text-mode server

The optional text-mode server lets automation harnesses stream ANSI snapshots
of the 80Ã—25 text plane, capture cursor metadata, and drive simulated keyboard
input over a localhost TCP socketâ€”no debugger or ptrace hooks required. It is
disabled by default; enable it in the configuration file whenever you need a
headless interface.

### Configuration

```
[textmode_server]
enable = true             # start the service (default: false)
port = 6000               # listener port (uint16)
show_attributes = true    # emit 24-bit ANSI colour or plain text
sentinel = ðŸ–µ             # UTF-8 delimiter before the payload (defaults to ðŸ–µ)
close_after_response = false  # close sockets immediately after replies

# TYPE macro behaviour
macro_interkey_frames = 1      # frame delay inserted between expanded characters
queue_non_frame_commands = true  # queue TYPE even without GET/VIEW
allow_deferred_frames = true     # allow deferred GET/VIEW replies
```

The service generates UTF-8 metadata lines prefixed by the sentinel (columns,
rows, cursor, colour mode, keys currently held) followed by a standalone
`sentinel + "PAYLOAD"` line and the ANSI frame. Colours are emitted as
true-colour SGR sequences that match the original DOS palette. When
`show_attributes=false`, plain CP437 characters are returned instead.

### Protocol

Commands are newline-terminated, case-sensitive verbs. The verbs themselves
must be uppercase; the server suggests the correct spelling and replies with
`ERR commands are case-sensitive` if it receives `get`, `type`, and so on.

| Command       | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `GET`         | Emit one snapshot (metadata + ANSI payload). |
| `GET SHOWSPC` | Same as `GET`, but spaces render as middle dots. |
| `TYPE â€¦`      | Enqueue keyboard events, delays, and optional frame capture. |
| `VIEW`        | Synonym for `GET` (allowed as a trailing token inside `TYPE`). |
| `STATS`       | Report cumulative request/success/failure counters plus `keys_down`. |
| `EXIT`        | Request a graceful emulator shutdown. |

### `TYPE` tokens

`TYPE` token parsing is intentionally strict to keep scripts reproducible:

- Tokens are whitespace-separated and case-sensitive. Invalid casing is logged
  to stderr alongside the expected spelling.
- Bare key names perform a `PRESS` (down + up). Append `Down` or `Up` to
  hold/release keys manually (`TYPE ShiftDown P ShiftUp`).
- Double-quoted strings expand to character-wise typing with automatic
  `Shift` insertion (for example `TYPE "Peter" VIEW`). Escape quotes with
  `\"` and backslashes with `\\`.
- Delay tokens ending in `ms` apply millisecond waits. Tokens ending in
  `frame` or `frames` wait for presentation ticks processed by the queued
  scheduler (`TYPE A 3frames B`).
- Trailing `GET` or `VIEW` requests the post-input frame. Without either token
  the command replies with `OK`.
- Literal Enter can be sent as `Enter`, `Return`, or via `\n` inside quotes.
  The literal backslash key is expressed as `\\` when unquoted.
- Unrecognised tokens are ignored after a stderr warning so scripts keep
  running.

### Future enhancements

Work is underway to route every `TYPE` command through an asynchronous queue so
long macros no longer block the emulation thread before a trailing `VIEW`. The
queue already powers `<N>frames` delays and inter-key waits; upcoming work will
flush queued actions from the main poll loop and tighten the round-trip tests.

### Known issues

- On some hosts Git reports spurious modifications to
  `extras/windows-installer/.gitattributes` and
  `extras/windows-installer/dosbox_with_console.bat` due to CRLF conversions.
  The files are byte-identical to HEAD; review Git's autocrlf settings if the
  noise becomes distracting.

Additional examples and client snippets live in the
[text-mode server guide](https://www.dosbox-staging.org/getting-started/textmode-server/).

### Dynamically loaded dependencies

**FluidSynth** and **Slirp** are built separately as dynamic libraries (via
vcpkg) and are loaded on-demand at runtime if available. Please refer to the
[dosbox-staging-ext](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging-ext)
project for further details. To check the versions of these dependencies
included in our stable and dev build packages, check out the comments of the
[releases packages](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging-ext/releases) of
the [dosbox-staging-ext](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging-ext)
project.

For information on the optional **Nuked SC-55 CLAP** audio plugin, check out
the [plugin's GitHub repository](https://github.com/johnnovak/Nuked-SC55-CLAP/) (note Nuked SC-55
CLAP is _not_ a DOSBox Staging project).

### Linux, macOS

Install build dependencies appropriate for your OS:

``` shell
# Fedora
sudo dnf install ccache gcc-c++ meson alsa-lib-devel libatomic libpng-devel \
                 SDL2-devel SDL2_net-devel opusfile-devel \
                 fluidsynth-devel iir1-devel mt32emu-devel libslirp-devel \
                 speexdsp-devel libXi-devel zlib-ng-devel
```

``` shell
# Debian, Ubuntu
sudo apt install ccache build-essential libasound2-dev libatomic1 libpng-dev \
                 libsdl2-dev libsdl2-net-dev libopusfile-dev \
                 libfluidsynth-dev libslirp-dev libspeexdsp-dev libxi-dev

# Install Meson on Debian-11 "Bullseye" or Ubuntu-21.04 and newer
sudo apt install meson
```

``` shell
# Arch, Manjaro
sudo pacman -S ccache gcc meson alsa-lib libpng sdl2 sdl2_net \
               opusfile fluidsynth libslirp speexdsp libxi pkgconf
```

``` shell
# openSUSE
sudo zypper install ccache gcc gcc-c++ meson alsa-devel libatomic1 libpng-devel \
                    libSDL2-devel libSDL2_net-devel \
                    opusfile-devel fluidsynth-devel libmt32emu-devel libslirp-devel \
                    speexdsp libXi-devel
```

``` shell
# macOS
xcode-select --install
brew install cmake ccache meson libpng sdl2 sdl2_net opusfile \
     fluid-synth libslirp pkg-config python3 speexdsp
```

### Build and stay up-to-date with the latest sources

1. Check out the main branch:

    ``` shell
    # commit or stash any personal code changes
    git checkout main -f
    ```

2. Pull the latest updates. This is necessary every time you want a new build:

    ``` shell
    git pull
    ```

3. Set up the build. This is a one-time step either after cloning the repo or
    cleaning your working directories:

    ``` shell
    meson setup build
    ```

    The above enables all of DOSBox Staging's functional features. If you're
    interested in seeing all of Meson's setup options, run `meson configure`.

4. Compile the sources. This is necessary every time you want a new build:

    ``` shell
    meson compile -C build
    ```

    Your binary is: `build/dosbox`

    The binary depends on local resources relative to it, so we suggest
    symlinking to the binary from your `PATH`, such as into `~/.local/bin/`.


### Windows â€“ Visual Studio (2022 or newer)

First, you need to setup [vcpkg] to install build dependencies. Once vcpkg
is bootstrapped, open PowerShell and run:

``` powershell
PS:\> .\vcpkg integrate install
```

This step will ensure that MSVC can use vcpkg to build, find and links all
dependencies.

Start Visual Studio and open the file `vs\dosbox.sln`. Make sure you have
`x64` selected as the solution platform.  Use **Ctrl+Shift+B** to build all
projects.

Note, the first time you build a configuration, dependencies will be built
automatically and stored in the `vcpkg_installed` directory. This can take
a significant length of time.
